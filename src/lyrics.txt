can't
nobody
get
control
of

your
brother's

was
just
gon'
say
whatever
that
you
told
him

at
a
certain
point
i
had
to
stop
asking
questions

dirt
on
each
other
like
mud
wrestlers

heard
he
bought
some
coke

girl
you
getting
blackmailed
for
that
white
girl

you'll
probably
find
one
of
them
"i
like
art"-type
girls
all
of
the
lights
she-was-caught-in-the-hype
girl

i
was
satisfied
being
in
love
with
the
lie
now
who
to
blame
you
to
blame
me
to
blame
for
the
pain
and
it
poured
every
time
when
it
rained
let's
play
the
blame
game
"things
used
to
be
now
they
not
anything
but
us
is
who
we
are
disguising
ourselves
as
secret
lovers
we've
become
public
enemies
we
walk
away
like
strangers
in
the
street
gone
for
eternity
we
erased
one
another
so
far
from
where
we
came
with
so
much
of
everything
how
do
we
leave
with
nothing
lack
of
visual
empathy
equates
the
meaning
of
l-o-v-e
hatred
and
attitude
tear
us
entirely"

every
motherfucker

me
that
i
couldn't
rhyme

i
could
let

dream
killers

my
self-esteem
or
use
my
arrogance
as
the
steam
to
power
my
dreams
i
use
it
as
my
gas
so
they
say
that
i'm
gassed
but
without
it
i'd
be
last
so
i
ought
to
laugh
so
i
don't
listen
to
the
suits
behind
the
desk

suits
cause
you
can't
dress

say
shit

kanye

i
rocked
20
000
people
i
was
just
on
tour
nigga
i'm
kan
the
louis
vuitton
don
bought
my
mom
a
purse
now
she
louis
vuitton
mom
i
ain't
play
the
hand
i
was
dealt
i
changed
my
cards
i
prayed
to
the
skies
and
i
changed
my
stars
i
went
to
the
malls
and
i
balled
too
hard
"oh
my
god
is
that
a
black
card
"
i
turned
around
and
replied
"why
yes
but
i
prefer
the
term
african
american
express"
brains
power
and
muscle
like
dame
puffy
and
russell
your
boy
back
on
his
hustle
you
know
what
i've
been
up
to
killin
y'all
niggas
on
that
lyrical
shit
mayonnaise-colored
benz
i
push
miracle
whips
i
met
this
girl
when
i
was
3
years
old
and
what
i
loved
most
she
had
so
much
soul
she
said
"excuse
me
lil
homie
i
know
you
don't
know
me
but
my
name
is
windy
and
i
like
to
blow
trees"
and
from
that
point
i
never
blow
her
off
niggas
come
from
out
of
town
i
like
to
show
her
off
they
like
to
act
tough
she
like
to
tow
'em
off
and
make
'em
straighten
up
their
hat
'cause
she
know
they
soft
and
when
i
grew
up
she
showed
me
how
to
go
downtown
in
the
nighttime
her
face
lit
up
so
astoundin'
i
told
her
in
my
heart
is
where
she'll
always
be
she
never
messed
with
entertainers
cause
they
always
leave
she
said
"it
felt
like
they
walked
and
drove
on
me"
knew
i
was
gang
affiliated
got
on
tv
and
told
on
me
i
guess
that's
why
last
winter
she
got
so
cold
on
me
she
said
"'ye
keep
making
that
keep
making
that
keep
making
that
platinum
and
gold
for
me!"
but
if
you
really
cared
for
her
then
you
wouldn't
have
never
hit
the
airport
to
follow
your
dreams
sometimes
i
still
talk
to
her
but
when
i
talk
to
her
it
always
seems
like
she
talking
'bout
me
she
said
"you
left
your
kids
and
they
just
like
you
they
wanna
rap
and
make
soul
beats
just
like
you
but
they
just
not
you"
and
i
just
got
through
talking
'bout
what
we
tryin'
to
do:
just
not
new
now
everybody
got
the
game
figured
out
all
wrong
i
guess
you
never
know
what
you
got
'til
it's
gone
i
guess
that's
why
i'm
here
and
i
can't
come
back
home
and
guess
when
i
heard
that
when
i
was
back
home
every
interview
i'm
representin'
you
makin'
you
proud
reach
for
the
stars
so
if
you
fall
you
land
on
a
cloud
jump
in
the
crowd
spark
your
lighters
wave
'em
around
if
you
don't
know
by
now
i'm
talking
'bout
chi-town
it
was
all
good

baltimore

people

the
art
of

for
the
clothes

my
stress
and
you're
my
masseuse
ma
ma
se
ma
ma
se
ma
ma
ku
sa
lost
in
this
plastic
life
let's
break
out
of
this
fake-ass
party
turn
this
into
a
classic
night
if
we
die
in
each
others
arms
still
get
laid
in
the
afterlife
if
we
die
in
each
others
arms
still
get
laid
yeah
yeah
yeah
my
wife
said
i
can't
say
no
to
nobody
and
at
this
rate
we
gon'
both
die
broke
got
friends
that
ask
me
for
money
knowin'
i'm
in
debt
and
like
my
wife
said
i
still
didn't
say
no
people
tryna
say
i'm
goin'
crazy
on
twitter
my
friends'
best
advice
was
to
stay
low
i
guess
it's
hard
to
decipher
all
of
the
bills
especially
when
you
got
family
members
on
payroll
the
media
said
it
was
outlandish
spendin'
the
media
said
he's
way
out
of
control
i
just
feel
like
i'm
the
only
one
not
pretendin'
i'm
not
out
of
control
i'm
just
not
in
they
control
i
know
i'm
the
most
influential
that
time
cover
was
just
confirmation
this
generation's
closest
thing
to
einstein
so
don't
worry
about
me
i'm
fine
i
can
see
a
thousand
years
from
now
in
real
life
skate
on
the
paradigm
and
shift
it
when
i
feel
like
troll
conventional
thought
don't
need
to
question
i
know
it's
antiquated
so
sometimes
i
get
aggressive
thank
god
for
jay
electra
he
down
with
the
mission
did
it
with
with
no
permission
on
our
own
conditions
most
blacks
with
money
have
been
beaten
to
submission
yeezy
with
the
big
house
did
it
way
different
never
listen
to
hollywood
producers
don't
stare
at
money
too
long
it's
medusa
the
ultimate
gemini

survived
i
wasn't
supposed

it
past

been
wakin'
the
spirits
of
millions
more
to

a
million

presentation
he
sat
back

worse
than

black
crime
the
jews
share
their
truth

most
black

while

get
this
havin'
money's
not

it

i

splurgin'
on
tryst
but
when
i
get
my
card
back
activated
i'm
back
to
vegas
cause
(the
good
life)
i
always
had
a
passion
for
flashin'
befo'
i
had
it
i
closed
my
eyes
and
imagined
the
good
life
back
when
they
thought
pink
polos
would
hurt
the
roc
before
cam
got
the
shit
to
pop
the
doors
was
closed
i
felt
like
bad
boy's
street
team;
i
couldn't
work
the
locks
now
let's
go
take
'em
back
to
the
plan
me
and
my
momma
hopped
in
that
u-haul
van
any
pessimists
i
ain't
talk
to
them
plus
i
ain't
have
no
phone
in
my
apart-a-ment
let's
take
'em
back
to
the
club
least
about
an
hour
i
stand
on
line
i
just
wanted
to
dance
i
went
to
jacob
an
hour
after
i
got
my
advance
i
just
wanted
to
shine
jay
favorite
line:
"dawg
in
due
time!"
now
he
look
at
me
like
"damn
dawg!
you
where
i
am!"
a
hip-hop
legend
i
think
i
died
in
that
accident
'cause
this
must
be
heaven
back
when
gucci
was
the
shit
to
rock
back
when
slick
rick
got
the
shit
to
pop
i'd
do
anything
to
say
i
got
it
damn
them
new
loafers
hurt
my
pocket
before
anybody
wanted
k
west
beats
me
and
my
girl
split
the
buffet
at
kfc
dog
i
was
having
nervous
breakdowns
like
"man
these
niggas
that
much
better
than
me
"
baby
i'm
going
on
an
aeroplane
and
i
don't
know
if
i'll
be
back
again
sure
enough
i
sent
the
plane
tickets
but
when
she
came
to
kick
it
things
became
different
any
girl
i
cheated
on
sheets
i
skeeted
on
couldn't
keep
it
at
home
thought
i
needed
a
nia
long
i'm
trying
to
right
my
wrongs
but
it's
funny
them
same
wrongs
helped
me
write
this
song
close
your
eyes
and
imagine
feel
the
magic
vegas
on
acid
seen
through
yves
st
laurent
glasses
and
i've
realized
that
i've
arrived
cause
it
take
more
than
a
magazine
to
kill
my
vibe
does
he
write
his
own
rhymes
well
sort
of
i
think
'em
that
mean
i
forgot
better
shit
than
you
ever
thought
of
damn
is
he
really
that
caught
up
i
ask
if
you
talked
about
classics
do
my
name
get
brought
up
i
remember
i
couldn't
afford
a
ford
escort
or
even
a
four-track
recorder
so
it's
only
right
that
i
let
the
top
drop
on
a
drop-top
porsche
it's
for
yourself
that's
important
if
your
stripper
name
"porscha"
and
you
get
tips
from
many
men
then
your
fat
friend
her
nickname
is
"minivan"
excuse
me
that's
just
the
henny
man
i
smoke
i
drink
i'm
supposed
to
stop
i
can't
because
i
was
sick
about
awards
couldn't
nobody
cure
me
only
playa
that
got
robbed
but
kept
all
his
jewelry
alicia
keys
tried
to
talk
some
sense
in
him
30
minutes
later
sein'
there's
no
convincin'
him
what
more
could
you
ask
for
the
international
asshole
who
complain
about
what
he
is
owed
and
throw
a
tantrum
like
he
is
3
years
old
you
gotta
love
it
though
somebody
still
speaks
from
his
soul
and
wouldn't
change
by
the
change
or
the
game
or
the
fame
when
he
came
in
the
game
he
made
his
own
lane
now
all
i
need
is
y'all
to
pronounce
my
name
it's
kanye
but
some
of
my
plaques
they
still
say
kayne
got
family
in
the
d
kin-folk
from
motown
back
in
the
chi
them
folks
ain't
from
moe

he
took
me
to
church
and
let
the
water
wash
over
my
caesar
the
preacher

leaders
right
then
my
body

still
like
a
paraplegic
you

got
a
message
then
leave
it
the
roc
stand
tall
and
you
would
never
believe
it
take
your
diamonds
and
throw
'em
up
like

the
flow
is
anemic
after
debris
settles
and
the
dust

the
indian
dance
to
bring
our
reign
back
"what's
up
with
you

"
they
pray
for
the
death
of
our
dynasty
like
"amen"
r-r-r-r-right
here
stands
a
man
with
the
power
to
make
a
diamond
with
his
bare
hands
i
get
down
for
my
grandfather
who
took
my
mama
made
her
sit
in
that
seat
where
white
folks
ain't
want
us
to
eat
at
the
tender
age
of
6
she
was
arrested
for
the
sit-ins
and
with
that
in
my
blood
i
was
born
to
be
different
now
niggas

choose
leadership
but
we
can
make
it
to
jacob's

to
the
dealership

i
just
don't

to
church
and

my
hands
scrubbed

baptized
'least
3
or
4
times
but
in
the
land
where
niggas

yukons
and
getting
paid
its
gonna
take
a
lot
more
than
coupons
to
get
us
saved
like
it
take
a
lot
more
than
doo
rags
to
get
you
waves
nothing
sad
as
that
day
my
girl's
father
passed
away
so
i
promised
to
mr
rainey
i'm
gonna
marry
your
daughter
and
you
know
i
gotta
thank
you
for
the
way
that
she
was
brought
up
and
i
know
that
you
were
smiling
when
you
see
the
car
i
bought
her
you
sent
tears
from
heaven
when
you
seen
my
car
get
balled
up
but
i
can't
complain
what
the
accident
did
to
my
left
eye
cause
look
what
an
accident
did
to
left
eye
first
aaliyah
now
romeo
must
die
i
know
i
got
angels
watching
me
from
the
other
side
it's
the
hard
knock
life
tour
sellout;
picture
us
in
the
mall
coppin'
iceberg
and
yell
out
"jigga"
yeah
that's
what
we'll
yell
out
yell
out
you
know
the
name
do
i
gotta
spell
out
or
tell
'bout
j-a-y
and
'ye
so
shy
now
he
won't
even
step
to
his
idol
to
say
hi
standing
there
like
a
mime
and
let
the
chance
pass
by
back
of
my
mind
"he
could
change
your
life
with
all
these
beats
i
did
at
least
let
him
hear
it
at
least
you
can
brag
to
ya
friends
back
at
the
gig"
but
he
got
me
out
me
out
my
momma
crib
then
he
help
me
get
my
momma
a
crib
fresh
off
the
plane
i'm
off
to
baseline
nothing
handed
out
i'm
'bout
to
take
mine
'round
the
same
time
of
that
blueprint
1
and
these
beats
in
my
pocket
was
that
blueprint
for
him
i'd
play
my
little
songs
in
that
old
back
room
he'd
bob
his
head
and
say
"damn!
oh
that's
you
"
but
by
the
black
album
i
was
blacking
out
partyin'
s
o
b
's
and
we
had
packed
a
crowd
big
brother
got
his
show
up
at
madison
square
and
i'm
like
"yeah
yeah
we
gon'
be
there"
but
not
only
did
i
not
get
a
chance
to
spit
it
carline
told
me
i
could
buy
two
tickets
i
guess
big
brother
was
thinkin'
a
little
different
and
kept
little
brother
at
bay
at
a
distance
but
everything
that
i
felt
was
more
bogus
only
made
me
more
focused
only
wrote
more
potent
only
thing
i
wanna
know
is
why
i
get
looked
over
i
guess
i'll
understand
when
i
get
more
older
big
brother
saw
me
at
the
bottom
of
the
totem
now
i'm
on
the
top
and
everybody
on
the
scrotum
have
you
ever
walked
in
the
shadow
of
a
giant
not
only
a
client
the
presidito
hola
hovito
the
game
gettin'
foul
so
here's
a
free
throw
i
was
always
on
the
other
side
of
the
peephole
then
i
dropped
"jesus
walks"
now
i'm
on
the
steeple
and
we
know
"new
jack
city"
got
to
keep
my
brother
but
to
be
number
one
i'mma
beat
my
brother
on
that
"diamonds"
remix
i
swore
i
spazzed
then
my
big
brother
came
through
and
kicked
my
ass
sibling
rivalry
only
i
could
see
it
was
the
pride
in
me
that
was
drivin'
me
at
the
grammys
i
said
"i
inspired
me"
but
my
big
brother
who
i
always
tried
to
be
when
i
kicked
a
flow
it
like
pick-and-roll
cause
even
if
he
gave
me
the
rock
it's
give-and-go
i
guess
beanie's
style
was
more
of
a
slam
dunk
but
my
shit
was
more
like
a
finger
roll
but
i
had
them
singles
though
and
them
hoes
at
the
show
gonna
mingle
yo
heh
y'all
know
i
told
jay
i
did
a
song
with
coldplay
next
thing
i
know
he
got
a
song
with
coldplay
back
in
my
mind
i'm
like
"damn
no
way"
translate
espanol
"no
way
jose"
then
i
went
and
told
jay
brown
shoulda
known
that
was
gonna
come
back
around
shoulda
talked
to
you
like
a
man
shoulda
told
you
first
but
i
told
somebody
else
and
that's
what
made
shit
worse
and
i'll
never
let
my
son
have
an
ego
he'll
be
nice
to
everyone
wherever
we
go
i
mean
i
might
even
make
him
be
republican
so
everybody
know
he
love
white
people
and
i'll
never
let
him
leave
his
college
girlfriend
and
get
caught
up
with
the
groupies
in
the
whirlwind
and
i'll
never
let
him
ever
hit
the
telethon
i
mean
even
if
people
dyin'
and
the
world
ends
see
i
just
want
him
to
have
an
easy
life
not
like
yeezy
life
just
want
him
to
be
someone
people
like
don't
want
him
to
be
hated
all
the
time
judged
don't
be
like
your
daddy
that
would
never
budge
and
i'll
never
let
him
ever
hit
a
strip
club
i
learned
the
hard
way
that
ain't
the
place
to
get
love
and
i'll
never
let
his
mom
move
to
la
knowin'
she
couldn't
take
the
pressure
now
we
all
pray
i
think
i
just

hot
cars
things
we
see
on
the

-
i
know
it
they
say
people
in
your
life
for
seasons
and
anything
that

to
squeezing
and
gran
keep
praying
and
keep
believing
in
jesus
and
one
day
that
you
see
him
'til
then
walk
in
his
footsteps
and
try
to
be
him
the
devil
is
alive
i
feel
him
breathin
claiming
money
is
the
key
so
keep
on
dreamin
and
put
them
lottery
tickets
just
to
tease
us
my
aunt
pam

put
them
cigarettes
down

my
little
cousin

them
cigarettes
now
his
job

to
claim
that
he
too
niggerish
now

it
cause

a
satin
gown
you
asleep
with
no
make-up
i'm
just
tryna
be
inside
you
'fore

it's
all
in
the
past

problems
baby

i
used
to
do
things
that'd
make
you
laugh
like
orderin'
a
girl
drink
in
a
masculine
glass
you
like
piña
coladas
getting
caught
in
the
rain
or
rocking
flannels
all
summer
like
kurt
cobain
or
that
dolce
gabbana
with
a
few
gold
chains
and
you
the
type
of
girl
that
probably
deserve
a
new
last
name
but
they
never
let
us
do
our
thing
everybody
lying
on
who
i
bang
we
was
on
fire
but
they
blew
our
flame
ain't
no
denying
baby
you
have
changed
cause
now
your
high
heels
clicking
your
lip
gloss
glisten
your
hips
start
switching
you're
pissed
off
tripping
cause
even
when
we're
kissing
baby

feel
different
friends
all
diss
him

"no

that
they
got
you
going
crazy

it
off
and
say
"how

well
some
of
the

tissue
is
you
can
still
be
who

that's
what
intuition
is
when

hop
back
in

car
drive
back
to
the
crib
run
back
to
their
arms
the
smokescreens
the
chokes
and

polished
i
got
a
right
to
be
a
lil
bit
snobbish
i
did
a
lil
bit
of
college
semesters
it
took
two
like
rob
base
to
let
me
figure
out
this
wasn't
my
place
the
beat's
slow
'til
you
listen
to
my
pace
'cause
i
be
killing

feeling
it
but
i
expected
it
if
it's
classic
it's
gon'
last
forever
then
i'm
everywhere
you
never
been
and
better
than
i
ever
been
'bout
the
baddest
girl
i
ever
seen
straight
up
out
a
movie
scene
who
knew
she
was
a
drama
queen
that'd
turn
my
life
to
stephen
king's
up
late
night
like
she
on
patrol
checking
everything
like
i'm
on
parole
i
told
her
there's
some
things
she
don't
need
to
know
she
never
let
it
go
oh
just
looking
at
your
history
you're
like
the
girl
from
misery
she
said
she
ain't
take
it
to
this
degree
well
let's
agree
to
disagree
shorty
kind
of
crazy
but
it
turn
me
on
keep
it
up
enough
to
keep
it
going
on
i
told
her
there's
some
things
she
don't
need
to
know
she
never
let
it
go
oh
golly
more
of
that
bullshit
ice
rap
i
got
to
'pologize
to
mos
and
kweli
(probably)
but
is
it
cool
to
rap
about
gold
if
i
told
the
world
i
copped
it
from
ghana
and
mali
(mali!)
first
nigga
with
a
benz
and
a
backpack
ice
chain
carti
lens
and
a
knapsack
always
said
if
i
rapped
i'd
say
somethin'
significant
but
now
i'm
rappin'
'bout
money
hoes
and
rims
again
and
it's
still
about
the
benjamins
big
faced
hundreds
and
whatever
other
synonyms
strippers
named
cinnamon
more

jogging

when

about
your
appearance

but
you

stop
staring
i
drew
a
picture
of
her
that'd
make
her
proud
but
the
door
was
locked
and
the
tv
up
so
loud
i
screamed
out
"i
ain't
going
to
sleep
no
time
soon!
and
when
i
do
i'm
sleeping
in
my
mama's
room!"
twenty
years
later
where
has
the
time
gone
now
you
see
i'm
dating
having
problems
of
my
own
now
that
i'm
grown
the
tables
turned
around
i
never
thought
i'd
ever
raise
another
nigga's
child
he
don't
like
his
mama's
boyfriend
just
like
me
don't
wanna
do
the
wrong
thing
that's
very
un-spike
lee
but
he
be
like
d
bo
round
his
mama
there
cause
when
she
here
he
be
quiet
when
she
leave
he
be
talking

wilding
out
be
calm
i
don't
drink
the
drama
or
sip
the
dom-tyler-perry-on
"you
gonna
marry
my
mom
"
look
i
don't
read
palms
and
i
don't
read
psalms
but
i
did
take
little
man
to
church
took
little
man
to
school
look
little
man
kids
don't
make
the
rules
even
though
i
ain't
raised
you
you
your
mama's
angel
don't
get
it
twisted
baby
boy
i'll
ving
rhames
you
there
must
be
more
good
women
than
men
percentage
wise
so
her
chance
of
having
a
husband
just
minimized
that's
why
a
lot
of
girls
claim
they
ain't
into
guys
and
mess
with
other
girls
part
time
to
improvise
i
knew
she
wasn't
bi
no
i
seen
it
in
her
eyes
but
i'm
like
any
other
guy
trying
to
get
in
her
thighs
she
telling
me
about
how
black
people
should
enterprise
and
i'm
like
if
you
don't
get
your
ass
in
this
ride
from
enterprise
that
i
rented
yesterday
and
gotta
have
in
by
5
with
the
gas
fully
filled
up
like
i
didn't
drive
told
her
i
had
a
girl
nah
fuck
it
i
didn't
lie
told
her
this
rap
game
is
alright
i'm
just
getting
by
she
had
a
lil'
weed
and
would
get
a
lil'
high
and
i'm
looking
in
her
eyes
and
i'm
loving
her
vibe
told
me
back
in
95'
she
fell
in
love
with
the
tribe
boo
back
in
92'
i
was
just
like
you
please
don't
be
confused
by
the
ice
and
jewels
i'm
like
any
other
nigga
buy
ice
to
stay
cool
like
any
other
nigga
that
claim
they
hate
school
and
think
yeah
free's
banging
but
she's
no
rachel
was
it
something
i
did
wrong
yeah
i
know
i'm
wrong
she's
at
home
alone
and
i'm
always
gone
hate
it
when
she
mad
but
more
when
she
passive
now
she
on
the
internet
looking
for
classes
out
of
state
though
man
that
hurt
yo
but
i
got
work
though
and
i'm
at
work
yo
and
she
don't
call
a
lot
and
when
she
do
she
pouring
out
her
heart
you
never
listen
to
me
then
the
call
drop
hmmm
and
i
promised
her
everything
told
her
when
i
get
a
deal
i'll
get
her
a
wedding
ring
but
when
i
got
my
deal
i
was
back
in
the
ring
fighting
my
urges
strip
club
splurges
never
had
money
so
i
felt
like
a
virgin
and
i'm
trying
to
break
the
bank's
cherry
tryin'
to
see
can
i
afford
canaries
with
a
ferrari
and
a
dinner
date
with
halle
berry
went
from
fifty
g's
to
fifteen
hundred
in
a
week
no
i'm
trying
to
call
one
ring
two
rings
seven
rings
eight
rings
her
mother
picked
up
the
phone
like
she
in
school
and
she
don't
stay
here
no
more
i
guess
there's
more
good
women
than
men
percentage
wise
so
her
chance
of
having
a
husband
just
minimize
i
guess
that's
why
she
says
she
ain't
into
guys
and
focus
on
school
full-time
to
improvise
somebody
told
me
that
delta's
brownskinned
akas'
lightskinned
and
they
supposed
to
be
bougie
so
they
got
white
friends
first
day
of
school
i'mma
take
you
sight
seein'
show
you
what
we
do
on
weekends
for
excitement
she
said
"i
know
what
you
about
to
say
like
your
hypeman"
last
year
a
nigga
hit
her
and
now
she
only
date
white
men
and
if
a
nigga
even
wave
at
her
it's
frightnin'
but
roll
some
think
i'll
roll
some
to
know
some
if
we
both
honest
who
lasts
yeah
you
lie
spent
the
whole
summer
tryna
be
at
the
wrong
place
at
the
right
time
but
i
know
what's
mine
when
i
see
it
i
know
i
know
i
know
when
i
see
it
riding
down
the
405
baby
pacing
thinking
to
myself
if
i
should
make
it
right
when
i
pulled
up
to
the
light
and
then
my
phone
started
ringing
diamonds
in
the
colors
of
those
eyes
don't
know
why
but
i
know
a
sign
when
i
see
it
yeezy
ne-yo
the
remix

think
it's
time
to
hit
'em
with
the
mase
flow
my
uh
she
was
gettin
the
best
of
me
but
oooh

i
know
it's
especially
hard
with
all
these
girls
just
testing
me
uh
and
you
gon'
question
me
if
she
even
stand
next
to
me
but
you
should
laugh
cause
you
my
better
half
(woman
laughing)
and
these
girls
just
fighting
over
the
rest
of
me
right
now
it
feels
so
crazy
i
know
she
just
some
lady
and
my
outfit
is
just
so
80's
not
to
mention
mclaren
mercedes
and
the
26
inch
rim
wheels
looks
so
good
with
your
6-inch
heels
fly
that
you
be
on
gucci
on
aligned
by
louie
vuitton
and
we
high
as
the
way
we
cruising
on
high
like
i
like
mercury
why
do
i
mention
the
solar
system
cause
you
in
my
soul
and
system
and
we
gon'
take
her
home
with
this
one
i
got
something
that
you
gon'
like
you
got
something
that
i
can't
fight
we
got
something
that
we
both
gon'
like
my
homie
called
me
like
what
up
man
not
from
florida
but
what
up
fam
it's
been
a
whole
lot
of
hatin'
again
and
if
they
hatin'
on
me
damn
what
up
then
i
met
this
girl
when
i
was
3
years
old
and
what
i
loved
most
she
had
so
much
soul
she
said
"excuse
me
little
homey
i
know
you
don't
know
me
but
my
name
is
windy
and
i
like
to
blow
trees"
and
from
that
point
i
never
blow
her
off
niggas
come
from
out
of
town
i
like
to
show
her
off
they
like
to
act
tough
she
like
to
tow
'em
off
and
make
'em
straighten
up
they
hat
cause
she
know
they
soft
and
when
i
grew
up
she
showed
me
how
to
go
downtown
in
the
nighttime
her
face
lit
up
so
astoundin'
i
told
her
in
my
heart
is
where
she'll
always
be
she
never
messed
with
entertainers
cause
they
always
leave
she
said
it
felt
like
they
walked
and
drove
on
me
knew
i
was
gang
affiliated
got
on
tv
and
told
on
me
i
guess
that's
why
last
winter
she
got
so
cold
on
me
she
said
"'ye
keep
making
that
platinum
and
gold
for
me!"
but
if
you
really
cared
for
her
then
you
would
have
never
hit
the
airport
and
followed
your
dreams
sometimes
i
still
talk
to
her
but
when
i
talk
to
her
it
always
seem
like
she
talkin
bout
me
she
said
you
left
ya
kids
and
they
just
like
you
they
wanna
rap
and
make
soul
beats
just
like
you
but
they
just
not
you
and
i
just
got
through
talkin
bout
what
niggas
tryin
to
do
just
not
new
now
everybody
got
the
game
figured
out
all
wrong
i
guess
you
never
know
what
you
got
till
is
gone
i
guess
that's
why
i'm
here
and
i
can't
come
back
home
and
guess
when
i
heard
that
when
i
was
back
home
in
the
interviews
i'm
representin
you
makin
you
proud
shoot
for
the
stars
so
if
you
fall

on
the
clouds

to
rap

be
in
my
genes
i
got
a
laptop
in
my
back
pocket
my
pen'll
go
off
when
i
half-cock
it
got
a
fat
knot
from
that
rap
profit
made
a
living
and
a
killing
off
it
ever
since
bill
clinton
was
still
in
office
with
monica
lewinsky
feeling
on
his
nut-sack
i'm
an
mc
still
as
honest
but
as
rude
and
indecent
as
all

'em
all
with
this
slickety
gibbedy

able
to
break
a
motherfuckin'
table
over
the
back
of
a
couple
of
faggots
and
crack
it
in
half
only
realized
it
was
ironic
i
was
signed
to
aftermath
after
the
fact
how
could
i
not
blow
all

nothing
but
shoot
for
the
moon
since

rap
god
rap
god
all
my
people
from
the
front
to
the
back
nod
back
nod
the
way
i'm
racing
around
the
track
call
me
nascar
nascar
dale
earnhardt
of
the
trailer
park
the
white
trash
god
kneel
before
general
zod
this
planet's
krypton
no
asgard
asgard
so
you
be
thor
and
i'll
be
odin
you
rodent
i'm
omnipotent
let
off
then
i'm
reloading
immediately
with
these
bombs
i'm
totin'
and
i
should
not
be
woken
i'm
the
walking
dead
but
i'm
just
a
talking
head
a
zombie
floating
but
i
got
your
mom
deep
throating
i'm
out
my
ramen
noodle
we
have
nothing
in
common
poodle
i'm
a
doberman
pinch
yourself
in
the
arm
and
pay
homage
pupil
it's
me
my
honesty's
brutal
but
it's
honestly
futile
if
i
don't
utilize
what
i
do
though
for
good
at
least
once
in
a
while
so
i
wanna
make
sure
somewhere
in
this
chicken
scratch
i
scribble
and
doodle
enough
rhymes
to
maybe
to
try
and
help
get
some
people
through
tough
times
but
i
gotta
keep
a
few
punchlines
just
in
case
cause
even
you
unsigned
rappers
are
hungry
looking
at
me
like
it's
lunchtime
i
know
there
was
a
time
where
once
i
was
king
of
the
underground
but
i
still
rap
like
i'm
on
my
pharoahe
monch
grind
so
i
crunch
rhymes
but
sometimes
when
you
combine
appeal
with
the
skin
color
of
mine
you
get
too
big
and
here
they
come
trying
to
censor
you
like
that
one
line
i
said
on
"i'm
back"
from
the
marshall
mathers
lp
one
where
i
tried
to
say
i
take
seven
kids
from
columbine
put
'em
all
in
a
line
add
an
ak-47
a
revolver
and
a
nine
see
if
i
get
away
with
it
now
that
i
ain't
as
big
as
i
was
but
i've
morphed
into
an
immortal
coming
through
the
portal
you're
stuck
in
a
time
warp
from
2004
though
and
i
don't
know
what
the
fuck
that
you
rhyme
for
you're
pointless
as
rapunzel
with
fucking
cornrows
you're
like
normal
fuck
being
normal
and
i
just
bought
a
new
raygun
from
the
future
to
just
come
and
shoot
ya
like
when
fabolous
made
ray
j
mad
'cause
fab
said
he
looked
like
a
fag
at
maywhether's
pad
singin'
to
a
man
while
they
played
piano
man
oh
man
that
was
a
24/7
special
on
the
cable
channel
so
ray
j
went
straight
to
the
radio
station
the
very
next
day
"hey
fab
i'mma
kill
you"
lyrics
coming
at
you
at
supersonic
speed
jj
fad
uh
sama
lamaa
duma
lamaa
you
assuming
i'm
a
human
what
i
gotta
do
to
get
it
through
to
you
i'm
superhuman
innovative
and
i'm
made
of
rubber
so
that
anything
you
saying
ricocheting
off
of
me
and
it'll
glue
to
you
i'm
never
stating
more
than
never
demonstrating
how
to
give
a
motherfuckin'
audience
a
feeling
like
it's
levitating
never
fading
and
i
know
that
the
haters
are
forever
waiting
for
the
day
that
they
can
say
i
fell
off
they'd
be
celebrating
cause
i
know
the
way
to
get
'em
motivated
i
make
elevating
music
you
make
elevator
music
oh
he's
too
mainstream
well
that's
what
they
do
when
they
get
jealous
they
confuse
it
it's
not
hip
hop
it's
pop
cause
i
found
a
hella
way
to
fuse
it
with
rock
shock
rap
with
doc
throw
on
lose
yourself
and
make
'em
lose
it
i
don't
know
how
to
make
songs
like
that
i
don't
know
what
words
to
use
let
me
know
when
it
occurs
to
yousat
while
i'm
ripping
any
one
of
these
verses
diverse
as
you
it's
curtains
i'm
inadvertently
hurtin'
you
how
many
verses
i
gotta
murder
to
prove
that
if
you're
half
as
nice
at
songs
you
can
sacrifice
virgins
too
uh!
school
flunkie
pill
junky
but
look
at
the
accolades
the
skills
brung
me
full
of
myself
but
still
hungry
i
bully
myself
cause
i
make
me
do
what
i
put
my
mind
to
and
i'm
a
million
leagues
above
you
ill
when
i
speak
in
tongues
but
it's
still
tongue
in
cheek
fuck
you
i'm
drunk
so
satan
take
the
fucking
wheel
i'm
asleep
in
the
front
seat
bumping
heavy
d
and
the
boys
still
chunky
but
funky
but
in
my
head
there's
something
i
can
feel
tugging
and
struggling
angels
fight
with
devils
here's
what
they
want
from
me
they
asking
me
to
eliminate
some
of
the
women
hate
but
if
you
take
into
consideration
the
bitter
hatred
that
i
had
then
you
may
be
a
little
patient
and
more
sympathetic
to
the
situation
and
understand
the
discrimination
but
fuck
it
life's
handing
you
lemons
make
lemonade
then
but
if
i
can't
batter
the
women
how
the
fuck
am
i
supposed
to
bake
them
a
cake
then
don't
mistake
it
for
satan
it's
a
fatal
mistake
if
you
think
i
need
to
be
overseas
and
take
a
vacation
to
trip
a
broad
and
make
her
fall
on
her
face
and
don't
be
a
retard
be
a
king
think
not
why
be
a
king
when
you
can
be
a
god
break
'em
off

shooting
stars
i
could
really
use
a
wish
right
now
wish
right
now
wish
right
now
yeah
i
could
use
a
dream
or
a
genie
or
a
wish
to
go
back
to
a
place
much
simpler
than
this
'cause
after
all
the
partyin'
and
smashin'
and
crashin'
and
all
the
glitz
and
the
glam
and
the
fashion
and
all
the
pandemonium
and
all
the
madness
there
comes
a
time
where
you
fade
to
the
blackness
and
when
you
starin'
at
that
phone
in
your
lap
and
you're
hopin'
but
them
people
never
call
you
back
but
that's
just
how
the
story
unfolds
you
get
another
hand
soon
after
you
fold
and
when
your
plans
unravel
in
the
sand
what
would
you
wish
for
if
you
had
one
chance
so
airplane
airplane
sorry
i'm
late
i'm
on
my
way
so
don't
close
that
gate
if
i
don't
make
that
then
i'll
switch
my
flight
and
i'll
be
right
back
at
it
by
the
end
of
the
night
can
we
pretend
that
airplanes
in
the
night
sky
are
like
shooting
stars
shooting
stars
i
could
really
use
a
wish
right
now
wish

in

hell
of

i'll
go
back
to
the
days
before

call
the
rap
game
and
back
when

to
my
mixtape
and
back
before
i
tried
to
cover
up
my
slang
but
this
is
for
the
hater
what's
up
bobby
ray

can
i
get
a
wish
to
end
the
politics
and
get
back

the
music
that
started
this
shit
